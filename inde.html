  <h1 class="font-medium text-4xl text-center mt-3" id="#introduction"><u>Introduction</u></h1>
  <p class="text-4xl mt-3">Cristiano Ronaldo, often regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, is renowned for his extraordinary athleticism, goal-scoring prowess, and dedication to the sport. Born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, Ronaldo grew up in modest circumstances, with his passion for football becoming evident at a young age. This passion, coupled with an intense work ethic, propelled him to the heights of the sport.</p>
  <h1 class="font-medium text-4xl text-center mt-3" id="#startofcareer"><u>Start of Career</u></h1>
  <p class="text-4xl mt-3">Ronaldo's professional career began at Sporting CP in Lisbon, where he quickly garnered attention for his skills and agility on the ball. His performance impressed Sir Alex Ferguson, the legendary manager of Manchester United, who signed him in 2003. At Manchester United, Ronaldo developed into a complete player, refining his dribbling, shooting, and tactical awareness. Under Ferguson’s mentorship, he also gained mental toughness, which would become one of his strongest traits. During his time at United, Ronaldo won three English Premier League titles and his first Ballon d’Or in 2008, an award given to the world’s best player, cementing his place among the elite.</p>
  <h1 class="font-medium text-4xl text-center mt-3" id="outtro"><u>Outtro</u></h1>
  <p class="text-4xl mt-3">On the international stage, Ronaldo has been equally impactful, becoming the all-time leading scorer in men’s international football with Portugal. His contributions were critical to Portugal’s first major international triumph at Euro 2016 and their victory in the 2019 UEFA Nations League. His dedication to his national team reflects his enduring passion and pride for representing his country, further solidifying his legacy as an all-time great. <br>

    Beyond football, Ronaldo is known for his exceptional physical discipline. His rigorous training, strict diet, and dedication to peak physical fitness have enabled him to maintain a high level of performance even as he ages. Off the pitch, Ronaldo has built a successful brand, CR7, and is involved in various philanthropic initiatives, making him a global icon beyond just football. His legacy is characterized by his relentless drive, competitive spirit, and influence on the game, ensuring his place in the pantheon of football legends.</p>
